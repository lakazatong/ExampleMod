**Describe the circuit (or/and a screenshot)**
A description of the structure and purpose of the circuit.

**I have tried the following:**
[ ] Creating different variations of the buggy circuit (e.g. swapping component order, changing input/output sides)
[ ] Duplicating circuits and placing it down. Is it consistently buggy?
[ ] Changing the facing direction of the circuit

**Expected behavior**
What should happen instead?

**Environment**
 - Mod loader: [Fabric, Forge, NeoForge]
 - Minecraft version: [1.21.4, 1.21.1, ...]
